## Chapter I: Introduction: The Relationship of Theory to Practice  
## 第一章：引言——理论与实践的关系  

The purpose of this book is to revisit an age-old question: How does the practice of teaching a second language connect to what we know about how people actually acquire a second language?  
这本书的目的是重新探讨一个老问题：第二语言的教学实践，和我们对语言习得过程的认识之间是如何联系的？  

Typically, people approach this by presenting some research, laying out a theory, and then listing what it might mean for teaching. I’ll mostly stick to this plan. A big chunk of this book is about summarizing where we currently stand on second language acquisition theory. After that, I’ll share some broad conclusions about what this means for teaching methods and materials, and talk about what makes learning resources effective.  
通常，这个问题的解决方法是：先展示一些研究成果，再提出理论，最后列出理论对教学的意义。我基本会按照这个套路走。本书的大部分内容是总结当前第二语言习得理论的状态。之后，我会分享一些关于教学方法和材料的总体结论，并探讨什么样的学习资源更有效。  

But before we dive into all that, I want to make something clear: theory and research shouldn’t be the only things guiding how we teach languages. While this book focuses on theory and its implications, relying solely on theory can be risky.  
不过，在深入探讨这些之前，我想先说明一点：理论和研究不应该是指导语言教学的唯一依据。虽然本书重点在理论及其启示，但完全依赖理论可能有风险。  

There are at least three ways to figure out what works in teaching:  
解决教学问题至少有三种方法：  

1.Theory: Understanding how second language acquisition works.
理论：了解第二语言习得的运作机制。  

2.Applied research: Conducting experiments to see which teaching methods work best in practice.  
应用研究：通过实验验证哪些教学方法在实践中更有效。  

3.Experience and intuition: Learning from the insights and ideas of experienced teachers and learners.  
经验和直觉：从有经验的教师和学习者的见解和想法中学习。  

I’ll spend the rest of this introduction breaking these down and showing how they interact. In the end, I’ll argue that all three approaches actually lead us to the same place. Spoiler alert: The best methods for teaching languages involve making full use of what we already have—real people using the language for real communication.  
在这一章接下来的部分，我会详细说明这三种方法，并展示它们如何相互作用。最后，我会提出一个观点：所有这三种路径最终都会指向同一个方向。提前剧透一下：最好的语言教学方法就是充分利用我们已经拥有的资源——用语言进行真实沟通的人们。  

### A. Three Approaches to Method  
### A. 方法的三种路径  
1. Theory of Second Language Acquisition  
1. 第二语言习得理论  
The first area we’re going to look at is second language acquisition theory. This is the main focus of the book. As it stands today, second language acquisition theory is part of “theoretical linguistics,” which means it can be studied and developed without worrying too much about how it’s applied in the real world.  
我们首先要探讨的是第二语言习得理论，这是本书的核心重点。按照目前的状况，第二语言习得理论属于“理论语言学”的一部分，这意味着它可以不必过多考虑实际应用，专注于自身的研究与发展。  

Like any scientific theory, it’s built around hypotheses—general ideas that match up with experimental data. These hypotheses can come from anywhere: a flash of insight, a random dream, you name it. But the key is that they have to predict new data. If they do, they’re good to go. If they fail, even just once, they need to be revised or scrapped altogether.  
和任何科学理论一样，这套理论基于假设——也就是与实验数据一致的总体性观点。这些假设可能来自任何地方：一个灵感的闪现，甚至是一场梦。但关键是，它们必须能够预测新数据。如果能做到，那就很好。如果失败了，哪怕只有一次，这些假设就需要修改，甚至完全推翻。  

This means you can never really “prove” anything in science. You can only find supporting evidence. If you don’t find it—or worse, find evidence that contradicts your hypothesis—then you’re in trouble. Even if your hypothesis holds up, someone can always say, “You just don’t have enough evidence yet.” That’s why scientists never say something is “proven.” At best, they have a hypothesis they’re actively testing.  
这也意味着，科学中没有什么是“确凿无疑”的。你只能找到支持性的证据。如果找不到，或者更糟的是，发现了反对你的证据，那你就麻烦了。即使假设暂时成立，总会有人说：“你的证据还不够充分。”因此，科学家从来不会说某件事“被证明”了。他们最多会说，这是一种正在测试的假设。  

In this book, I’ll lay out a series of hypotheses that make up what I think is a coherent theory of second language acquisition. By scientific standards, it’s always going to be “just a theory,” never “proven.” But these hypotheses are backed by a lot of data, and so far, I haven’t found anything that seriously contradicts them.  
在本书中，我会提出一系列假设，这些假设组成了我认为连贯的第二语言习得理论。从科学标准来看，这永远只是“理论”，而不是“真理”。但这些假设得到了大量数据的支持，而且到目前为止，我还没发现什么严重矛盾的地方。  

That doesn’t mean I blindly “believe” in these ideas. It just means they seem to explain the data better than other existing theories, so they’re worth considering.  
这并不意味着我盲目“相信”这些观点。只是说，它们似乎比其他现有理论更能解释数据，因此值得认真思考。  

Good theory might sound abstract and impractical, but in the case of second language teaching, there’s nothing more practical than a solid theory.  
好的理论听起来可能有点抽象，不太实际，但对于第二语言教学来说，没有什么比一个扎实的理论更实用的了。  

2. Applied Linguistics Research  
2. 应用语言学研究  
The second area we’ll look at is applied linguistics research. This kind of research isn’t necessarily focused on building or testing a big, unified theory. Instead, it’s all about solving practical problems that come up in real life.  
第二个要探讨的领域是应用语言学研究。这类研究不一定是为了构建或验证某个大型统一的理论，而是专注于解决实际生活中出现的问题。  

For example, one common type of applied research involves comparing teaching methods. You take two groups of students: Group A learns a foreign language with Method A (like audio-lingual drills), while Group B uses Method B (like grammar-translation). Then you compare the results. The goal isn’t to confirm or deny a theory—it’s to figure out which method works better in a practical setting, like a classroom.  
比如，一个常见的应用研究类型是比较教学方法。你将学生分成两组：A组用方法A学习外语（比如听说训练法），B组用方法B（比如语法翻译法）。然后比较两组的学习效果。研究的目的不是验证某个理论，而是找出哪种方法在课堂等实际环境中更有效。  

Other practical questions applied research tackles include things like:  
应用研究还会处理其他实际问题，比如：  

Does learning a second language make children smarter? Or less smart?  
学习第二语言会让孩子变得更聪明吗？还是更不聪明？  

Should kids in bilingual education programs learn to read in their first language first, or should they start with English?  
双语教育中的孩子应该先学会用母语阅读，还是直接从英语开始？  

This kind of research is directly relevant to the challenges teachers, schools, and students face every day.  
这类研究直接针对教师、学校和学生每天面对的挑战。  

3. Ideas and Intuitions from Experience  
3. 基于经验的想法与直觉  
The third approach doesn’t rely on experiments or formal studies. It’s all about the practical insights and tips shared by experienced language teachers and learners. Think of it as the “what works for me” method.  
第三种路径不依赖实验或正式研究，而是来自经验丰富的语言教师和学习者的实际见解和技巧。可以把它理解为“对我有效的方法”。  

For example, a teacher might come up with a clever classroom technique or activity that seems to get great results. Or a language learner might keep a diary about what strategies helped them the most. These kinds of ideas often spread informally, through conferences, workshops, or newsletters.  
比如，一个老师可能发明了一种巧妙的课堂活动，效果显著；又或者，一个语言学习者记录了哪些学习策略对他们帮助最大。这类想法通常通过会议、研讨会或新闻通讯等非正式渠道传播开来。  

Unlike research studies, these ideas don’t usually come with hard evidence to back them up. But if they seem to work, people are willing to give them a try.  
和研究相比，这些想法通常没有确凿的数据支持。但只要看起来有效，人们就愿意去试试。  

### B. Interactions Among Approaches to Practice  
### B. 方法路径之间的相互作用  
Before discussing what each approach says about teaching methods, I’d like to propose something: these three approaches should influence and support each other. Researchers should pay attention to applied research, since it can provide valuable evidence for or against their theories. At the same time, applied researchers can gain insights from theoretical work to better understand their own findings.  
在讨论每种路径对教学方法的看法之前，我想提出一个观点：这三种路径应该相互影响并支持彼此。研究人员应该关注应用研究，因为它能为他们的理论提供支持性或反驳性的证据。同时，应用研究人员可以从理论工作中获得启发，更好地理解他们的研究发现。  

Language teachers and learners also have a lot to offer. If researchers took the time to teach or learn a language themselves, they’d gain valuable firsthand experience. Similarly, teachers and learners could benefit from engaging with the latest research—it might give them new ideas to try out in the classroom.  
语言教师和学习者同样可以提供很多有价值的见解。如果研究人员花点时间亲自教授或学习一门语言，他们会获得宝贵的第一手经验。同样，教师和学习者也可以通过接触最新的研究成果受益，这可能会为他们的课堂带来新灵感。  

If this sounds idealistic, well, it kind of is. In reality, these groups often don’t interact much. Many researchers are no longer involved in teaching or language learning, and they rarely talk to teachers. Applied research often ignores theory, and teachers tend to rely on their own experience rather than research findings.  
这听起来也许有点理想化，但现实是这些群体之间的互动通常很少。许多研究人员已经不再从事教学或语言学习，他们很少与教师交流。应用研究往往忽视理论，而教师通常更多地依赖自己的经验，而不是研究成果。  

There are reasons for this disconnect. Researchers in the past often insisted their theories were the only correct way to teach, even when those theories didn’t seem to work. When those methods failed, teachers blamed themselves instead of questioning the theory. Over time, they stopped looking to research for answers and relied more on intuition.  
这种脱节是有原因的。过去的研究人员常常坚持认为他们的理论是唯一正确的教学方法，即使这些理论似乎并不起作用。当这些方法失败时，教师会责怪自己，而不是质疑理论。久而久之，他们不再依赖研究寻找答案，而是更多依靠直觉。  

The result? Research and practice in language teaching have drifted apart. Theories don’t seem practical, applied research feels disconnected from the classroom, and teachers feel like they’re on their own. But it doesn’t have to be this way.  
The truth is, when you look closely, all three approaches—theory, applied research, and experience—actually align more often than you’d think. They just need better communication. If we can bridge these gaps, everyone benefits: researchers get new data, teachers get new tools, and students get better results.  
结果呢？语言教学中的研究和实践逐渐疏远了。理论看起来不够实用，应用研究似乎与课堂脱节，教师觉得只能靠自己解决问题。但情况并不一定要这样。  
事实上，如果仔细观察，理论、应用研究和经验这三种路径比想象中更加相辅相成。它们只需要更好的沟通。如果我们能弥合这些差距，大家都会受益：研究人员获得新的数据，教师得到新的工具，学生取得更好的学习效果。  

This book is my attempt to show that we can find common ground. I’ll argue that theory provides a solid foundation for teaching, but it needs to be tested and informed by real-world experience. Similarly, applied research should build on theory and focus on solving problems teachers actually face. And finally, teachers’ experiences and intuitions can inspire both research and practice.  

In short, we don’t need to pick just one path. We need all three. Each one has its strengths, and together they can give us a much clearer picture of what works in language teaching.    

这本书是我尝试证明我们能够找到共同点的努力。我会论证理论为教学提供了一个扎实的基础，但它需要通过真实世界的经验来验证和丰富。同样，应用研究应以理论为基础，并关注教师实际面临的问题。而最后，教师的经验和直觉可以为研究和实践提供灵感。    

简而言之，我们不需要只选择一条路径。我们需要三条路径共同发挥作用。每条路径都有其优势，而它们结合起来能让我们更清楚地看到哪些语言教学方法真正有效。  

### C. What the Three Approaches Have to Say About Method  
### C. 三种路径对方法的看法  

Each of the three approaches—theory, applied research, and experience—has something important to say about how we should teach languages. When you combine their insights, you get a pretty solid picture of what effective language teaching might look like.  

Let’s start with theory. As we’ll see in the next chapter, second language acquisition theory makes a big distinction between acquisition and learning. Put simply, acquisition happens naturally when you’re exposed to language you can understand. It’s unconscious and effortless, like how kids pick up their first language. On the other hand, learning is the conscious process of studying rules, memorizing vocabulary, and practicing drills.  

这三种路径——理论、应用研究和经验——对我们如何教授语言都有重要的启发。当你将它们的见解结合起来时，就可以勾勒出有效语言教学的清晰轮廓。

我们先从理论开始。在下一章中我们会看到，第二语言习得理论明确区分了“习得”和“学习”。简单来说，习得是指当你接触到能够理解的语言时，自然而然发生的过程。这是无意识且不费力的，就像孩子如何学习母语一样。而学习则是有意识的过程，包括研究语法规则、记忆单词和练习操练。

What does this mean for teaching? It means that, if we want to help students become fluent, we need to focus on creating opportunities for them to acquire language, not just learn it. This involves providing lots of “comprehensible input”—language that’s slightly above their current level but still understandable with some effort.  

Applied research supports this idea. Studies consistently show that methods emphasizing comprehensible input—like immersion programs or reading-based approaches—lead to better results than methods focused on grammar drills or memorization.  

这对教学有什么启示呢？这意味着，如果我们想帮助学生流利地使用语言，就需要更多地创造机会让他们习得语言，而不仅仅是学习语言。这需要提供大量“可理解输入”——也就是稍微超出学生当前水平但通过努力仍能理解的语言材料。  

应用研究也支持这一观点。研究结果表明，以可理解输入为核心的方法（如沉浸式学习或基于阅读的学习方法）比以语法操练或死记硬背为主的方法效果更好。  

Finally, let’s talk about experience. Many language teachers will tell you that students learn best when they’re engaged and motivated. This means the input we provide has to be interesting and relevant to their lives. It also means creating a low-stress environment, where students feel comfortable making mistakes and taking risks with the language.  

In short, theory, research, and experience all point to the same conclusion: the best way to teach a language is to focus on meaningful communication. Grammar drills and memorization might have their place, but they should take a backseat to activities that help students actually use the language in real-world contexts.  

最后，我们来说说经验。很多语言教师会告诉你，学生在参与度高、动力足的时候学得最好。这意味着我们提供的输入必须对学生来说既有趣又与他们的生活相关。同时，也需要营造一种低压力的环境，让学生感到舒适，从而敢于犯错并尝试使用语言。  

简而言之，理论、研究和经验都指向同一个结论：最好的语言教学方法是关注有意义的交流。语法操练和记忆可能有一定作用，但它们应该为帮助学生在真实情境中实际使用语言的活动让路。  

### D. Goals of This Book: To Reintroduce Teachers to Theory and Hopefully to Gain Their Confidence Again  
### D. 本书目标：重新引导教师关注理论，并希望重拾他们的信心  

This book has two main goals. The first is to give teachers a clear, practical understanding of second language acquisition theory. I want to show that theory isn’t some abstract, irrelevant thing. It’s actually very useful for figuring out how to help students succeed.  

The second goal is to rebuild teachers’ trust in research. For too long, teachers have been let down by researchers who made big promises but couldn’t deliver. I want to show that research can actually support what teachers already know from experience—and even give them new tools and ideas to work with.  

这本书有两个主要目标。第一个是为教师提供一个清晰、实用的第二语言习得理论的理解。我想证明，理论并不是某种抽象的、不相关的东西。实际上，它对帮助学生取得成功非常有用。  

第二个目标是重建教师对研究的信任。长期以来，研究人员的许多承诺无法兑现，让教师失望。我希望能够表明，研究实际上可以支持教师从经验中获得的认识，甚至为他们提供新的工具和方法。  

### Notes  
### 注释  

This book is written primarily for language teachers. My hope is that it will help them see how theory, research, and experience can all work together to improve language teaching. But I also think learners can benefit from understanding these ideas—knowing how language acquisition works can help them become more effective, independent learners.  

At the same time, I want to be upfront: this book is just a starting point. The field of second language acquisition is constantly evolving, and no single book can cover everything. My goal is to provide a foundation that teachers and learners can build on, whether through further study or by testing these ideas in their own classrooms and lives.  

这本书主要是写给语言教师的。我希望能帮助他们理解理论、研究和经验如何相互配合，从而改进语言教学。但我也认为，语言学习者同样能从这些观点中获益——了解语言习得的原理，可以帮助他们成为更高效、更独立的学习者。  

同时，我想坦率地说明：这本书只是一个起点。第二语言习得领域在不断发展，没有哪本书能涵盖所有内容。我的目标是提供一个基础，让教师和学习者可以在这个基础上继续深入研究，或者在他们的课堂和生活中验证这些观点。  

This book is divided into five chapters. Chapter II focuses on second language acquisition theory. I’ll present five key hypotheses that explain how language acquisition works and what factors influence it.  

Chapter III looks at how to create the right conditions for language acquisition in the classroom. We’ll explore the importance of providing comprehensible input and discuss the role of speaking and writing (or “output”) in the learning process.  

本书分为五章。第二章重点探讨第二语言习得理论。我将提出五个关键假设，解释语言习得的运作原理及其影响因素。  

第三章探讨如何在课堂中创造适合语言习得的条件。我们将讨论提供可理解输入的重要性，并探讨在学习过程中说和写（或“输出”）的作用。  

Chapter IV addresses the role of grammar in language teaching. We’ll examine whether explicit grammar instruction and error correction actually help students acquire language, and if so, how they should be used.  

Finally, Chapter V offers some practical ideas for language teaching. I’ll discuss how current teaching methods align (or don’t align) with what we know about language acquisition. I’ll also share some suggestions for designing better teaching materials and assessments.  

第四章讨论语法在语言教学中的作用。我们将研究明确的语法教学和错误纠正是否真的能帮助学生习得语言，如果有帮助的话，应该如何使用这些方法。  

最后，第五章提供了一些语言教学的实用建议。我将讨论当前的教学方法与我们对语言习得的理解是否一致（或者不一致），并分享一些关于设计更好的教学材料和评估方式的建议。  

This book isn’t meant to be the final word on language teaching—it’s more of an invitation to explore. I encourage you to think critically about the ideas presented here, test them out in your own practice, and adapt them to fit your unique context.  

Whether you’re a teacher, a student, or just someone interested in how languages are learned, I hope this book gives you some valuable insights and practical tools to work with.  

这本书并不是语言教学的最终定论——它更像是一种邀请，邀请你去探索。我鼓励你对书中的观点进行批判性思考，在自己的实践中测试这些观点，并根据自己的独特环境加以调整。  

无论你是教师、学生，还是对语言习得感兴趣的人，我都希望这本书能为你提供一些有价值的见解和实用的工具。
